### First Milestone Questions
* **Problem**: I plan to look at a snapshot of adoptable dogs across the United States (as posted on [Petfinder.com](https://www.petfinder.com)) to determine the predominant reported breeds of dogs within the shelter and rescue systems. In particular, I want to look at this distribution state-by-state.
* **Questions**:
    - For each state, what is the most populous reported breed found in shelters?
    - What is the current average length of stay (LOS) for each reported breed?
    - For each US geographical region, what are the top 10 reported breeds?
* **Justification**: Examining which reported dog breeds are most often ending up homeless and offered for adoption in local shelters/rescues may help to answer questions about breed popularity and dog ownership culture in the United States (and whether there are any region-specific trends). It may also help to answer questions about how meaningful a breed identity actually is in the context of animal rescue. [This professional study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008213/) determined that breed labels in dogs can influence their percieved adoptability and LOS. Hopefully, this analysis will provide some insight into how dog breed identity in shelter/rescue systems differs by region. The results could perhaps lead to further study or reinforce preexisting conclusions.
* **Datasets**: I am considering this dataset from 2019: https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/dog-shelters. Or I might consider how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the data, and may take it from the PetFinder API myself.
* **Ethical Concerns/Considerations**:
    - The results may cause people to draw false conclusions about why certain breeds often end up in shelters and rescues.
    - The results risk reinforcing biases associated with various dog breeds.
