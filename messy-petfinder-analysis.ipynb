    "## Project Details\n",
    "* **Problem**: I plan to look at a snapshot of adoptable dogs across the United States (as posted on [Petfinder.com](https://www.petfinder.com)) to determine the predominant reported breeds of dogs within the shelter and rescue systems. In particular, I want to look at this distribution state-by-state.\n",
    "* **Questions**:\n",
    "    - For each state, what is the most populous reported breed found in shelters?\n",
    "    - What is the current average length of stay (LOS) for each reported breed?\n",
    "    - For each US geographical region, what are the top 10 reported breeds?\n",
    "* **Justification**: Examining which reported dog breeds are most often ending up homeless and offered for adoption in local shelters/rescues may help to answer questions about breed popularity and dog ownership culture in the United States (and whether there are any region-specific trends). It may also help to answer questions about how meaningful a breed identity actually is in the context of animal rescue. [This professional study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008213/) determined that breed labels in dogs can influence their perceived adoptability and LOS. Hopefully, this analysis will provide some insight into how dog breed identity in shelter/rescue systems differs by region. The results could perhaps lead to further study or reinforce preexisting conclusions.\n",
    "* **Datasets**: [allDogDescriptions.csv](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/dog-shelters), a dataset of all adoptable dogs from petfinder.com on September 20th, 2019.\n",
    "* **Ethical Concerns/Considerations**:\n",
    "    - The results may cause people to draw false conclusions about why certain breeds often end up in shelters and rescues.\n",
    "    - The results risk reinforcing biases associated with various dog breeds.\n",
    "    - The results may influence rescue/shelter intake depending on the dog's perceived adoptability."
